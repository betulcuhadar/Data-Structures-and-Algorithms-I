# Data Structures and Algorithms - I Homeworks

## Homework Assignments:
- `Homework 1` : Java implementation of a graph data structure and includes methods to find cycles in the graph.
- `Homework 2` : Java program that evaluates the performance of five sorting algorithms implemented in the SortingAlgorithms class. It measures the execution time of these algorithms on arrays sorted in ascending, descending, and random order.
- `Homework 3` : It includes two classes: PlayerDatabase and UnixDirectory.
  - PlayerDatabase implements a player database using a binary search tree. It allows users to add players with their names, surnames, and transfer fees, remove players, search for players by name, search for players within a specified transfer fee range, print all players, and find the Kth the smallest player based on their transfer fee.
  - The UnixDirectory simulates a Unix-like directory structure using a tree data structure. It allows users to create directories with specified sizes, list subdirectories, remove directories, and calculate the total size of a directory and its subdirectories.
- `Homework 4` : It implements a priority queue data structure and includes a method to find the k the closest points to the origin in a two-dimensional space.
